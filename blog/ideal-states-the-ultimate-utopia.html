      In the Era of Anti-Utopia
    </p><span style="margin-left: 1em"></span></h4>
    <p>
      It is said that an ideal state,or Utopia,has been proved unrealistic and
      useless. There have been quantities of criticism such as George Orwell's
      <em>1984</em>, Aldous Leonard Huxley's <em>Brave New World</em>. If we
      look into other forms of art like film, painting and drama, chances are
      that Utopia will be the target of irony and central of topic. Many
      People object to the ideal state, referring to it as <em>harmful for
      humanity and freedom</em>, whether they are from the West or the East.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are,however,some misunderstanding about the concept of Utopia.
      When we talk about anti-utopia or <strong>dystopia</strong>,we tend to
      regard it as the objection to Utopia,which is not always true. The role
      of a Utopia is more like the guideline for current community,but too
      often the design of the ideal states seems ridiculous<sup><a id="fnref-1-50e7ffbbf1f6b845"></a>[1]</sup>.
      The role of Dystopia is similar,except that it is an awfully designed
      community which serves as a warning for politics revolution and some
      radical philosophy.<sup><a id="fnref-2-50e7ffbbf1f6b845"></a>[2]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      People often think the Utopia is a communist society.Indeed,from the
      westerners' points of view,communism is unrealistic and harmful in some
      ways as well. As long as there's no actual communist society
      established,I'll refer to it as a form of Utopia,but they are not
      equal.We'll see that from the early ages philosophers and politicians
      had begun to build their own ideal states,for the sake of themsevles and
      their political theory ,and of course not all of them contain the
      communism-relevant content.Some are realized while others remain Utopia.
      Personally speaking I advocate pursuing of better society but whether a
      certain architeture of society is good or bad is rather vague - Let's
      judge it with time.
    </p>
    <h4 id="auto-3"><p>
      Religious Ideal States
    </p><span style="margin-left: 1em"></span></h4>
    <p>
      Believe it or not,when we talk about ideal places,The Paradise,The Eden
      or The Olympia will come to mind.Our ancestor did their best to describe
      happiness,order,and harmony in these places,probably by telling stories
      about myths and gods. Take Eden for example:
    </p>
    <div style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 70.291740657624px; margin-right: 70.291740657624px">
      <p>
        <em>The LORD God planted a garden toward the east, in Eden; and there
        He placed the man whom He had formed. Out of the ground the LORD God
        caused to grow every tree that is pleasing to the sight and good for
        food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree
        of the knowledge of good and evil.</em>
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      We assume in the early ages these myths and scripts were produced by the
      whole people.It at least indicated back when the living standard was not
      so high and people suffered all kinds of torments an ideal state or
      place was the consequence of our ancestors' yearning for better
      conditions.Even to middle ages and till now those not content with
      current life will pursue the chance of going to paradise after death.For
      them,even if they do not believe in or haven't heard of any political or
      philosophical Utopia,they are longing for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But roughly speaking the depiction of the ideal religous place has few
      things to do with politics and society architecture.Religions use them
      as tools to attract believers and achieve goals.The better a paradise
      is,the more devout followers will be,probably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe the ideal places described in religious classicals are not seemed
      as bad things just because everyone wants a heaven,and it occurred to me
      that there is nobody completely hating Utopia.If we have the chance of
      realizing them,for what reason we shall not adopt those lovely good
      community form ?For centuries people are intoxicated by the hope of
      going to heaven,but compared to the life after death,let's focus on our
      life in possible future in reality,which has been forseen and predicted
      by many wise men,the majority of whom are philosophers.

      Ideal States by Philosophers
    </p><span style="margin-left: 1em"></span></h4>
    <p>
      After Enlightment ,'<em>Liberty,Equality,Fraternity</em>' became a
      famous motto. But from the date of its birth,people keep arguing about
      the order of these three things<a id="fnref-3-50e7ffbbf1f6b845"></a><a href="app://obsidian.md/index.html#fn-3-50e7ffbbf1f6b845">[3]</a> and finally
      lead to totally different ideologies. If a society wants absolute
      liberty,then there will be no equality,as the strong will always beat
      the weak,which is caused by <strong>freedom</strong>.Likewise,if we
      advocate absolute equality,people stronger and more intelligent cannnot
      take the advantage of their inborn talents.We have seen too many
      examples such as USA,which is <em>the lighthouse of freedom and
      democracy</em> but also where discrimination between genders and races
      will never be solved, and PRC,which chooses to restrict liberty and the
      level of equality is relatively high.
    </p>
    <p>
      The preferrence for liberty or equality can be roughly regarded as the
      fundamental of the underlying difference.And Utopia can be divided
      accrodingly:some Utopias are designed to make everyone completely free
      and there will be restrictions on democracy and authorities. Some force
      equality among classes and individuals are not allowed to own personal
      property,instead it will be allocated by the nation. Roughly they are
      possible future of capitalism and communism society.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first philosopher in history to design an ideal state is Plato,in
      his book <em>Republic</em>. Due to his teacher Socrates' death
      originated from the abuse of democrocy in ancient Athens,Plato lost his
      faith in democracy and designed his own ideal state to be powered by
      <strong>philosophers</strong>,which is the top class or
      <em>King</em>.Other classes include police/military officers and common
      citizens.There will be nearly no transitions between two classes and no
      democracy involved in state affairs.Nobody should make statements about
      <em>king</em>'s behaviours and violate the national interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interestingly Plato objected to liberty and equality both. He thought
      liberty will cause slavery in the future as the strong will enslave the
      weak.At the same time he only approved the wisdom of philosophers,which
      leads to oligarchy.He insisted the government shall be composed of
      philosophers because they will not corrupt.Governers will tell <em>the
      nobal lie</em> (&gamma;&epsilon;&nu;&nu;&alpha;&#x1FD6;&omicron;&nu;
      &psi;&epsilon;&#x1FE6;&delta;&omicron;&sigmaf;) to make the people
      believe that they are born in a certain class and should not change that
      ,as is described in the book:

        as if their land were their mother and their nurse, they ought to take

        other citizens as their brothers and children of the self-same

        the most precious &mdash; but in the helpers, silver, and iron and

        though for the most part you will breed after your kinds, it may

        that a golden offspring would come from a silver sire, and that the
        rest would, in like manner, be born of one another. So that the first
        and chief injunction that the god lays upon the rulers is that of
        nothing else are they to be such careful guardians, and so intently
        observant as of the intermixture of these metals in the souls of their
        offspring, and if sons are born to them with an infusion of brass or
        iron they shall by no means give way to pity in their treatment of
        them, but shall assign to each the status due to his nature and thrust
        them out among the artisans or the farmers. And again, if from these
        there is born a son with unexpected gold or silver in his composition
        they shall honor such and bid them go up higher, some to the office of
        guardian, some to the assistanceship, alleging that there is an oracle
        that the city shall then be overthrown when the man of iron or brass
        is its guardian.</em><sup><a id="fnref-4-50e7ffbbf1f6b845"></a>[4]</sup>

      Plato's ideal state had never been realized and had been the target of
      criticism by his own student <em>Aristotle</em> and many philpsophers
      afterewards,but he was the first to express his political and
      philosophical ideas with an ideal society. When it came to the days
      after the Renassiance,Sir Thomas More wrote the famous book called
      <em>Utopia</em> and inherited Plato's concept of an Ideal State,while
      its target of criticism is the society of England where <em>the sheep is
      eating men</em>,during the early ages of industrial revolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his <em>Utopia</em>,More promoted his idea of absolute equality.Like
      in <em>Republic</em>,people have no personal property.But furthermore
      ,More designed the state to allocate <strong>all things</strong>
      including dormitories and even wives and husbands.For More and later
      philosophers like <em>Andria</em> and <em>Tommaso
      Campanella</em>,equality is obviously more important than liberty.The
      case is :if all men are happy,there will be no need for freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      When later Marx developed his own political theory,More and his
      followers were all categoried as advocators of utopian socialism.And
      Karl Popper criticized Plato and them as advocators of
      totalitarianism.However,their way of expressing ivory and political
      ideas is absorbed by later philosophers and politicians - depicting a
      bright future for the citizens will always happen during election,but
      after that you may refer to it as a <em>Utopia</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Marx and other philosophers have their own design as well,they
      are not concrete enough and most of them are just inferences of
      philosophy theory.So I'll ignore these <strong>modern</strong>
      philosophers and talk about my own understanding of the ultimate Utopia.

      My Utopia

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The society should emphasis on equality more than on liberty:
        </p>
        <p>
          Libertists cannoot stand the elimination of oppurtunities,probably
          because they are in the upper class or they are stronger than most
          of others.So they can use their current power and easily succeed in
          the competition with others.It's the biggest shortcoming of
          liberty.And let's put it this way,when we allow liberty,we are
          actually eliminating liberty because the strong is always strong and
          the weak is always weak,nobody from the lower class have the liberty
          - liberty is only for those with most money and power.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          There should be no property
        </p>
        <p>
          Rousseau has said that the unequality between people originated from
          pricate ownership.To achieve equality we must eliminate personal
          property.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          People must labour
        </p>
        <p>
          A major concern for the Utopia or communism society is that when
          resources are not allocated by labour people will be lazy - and this
          had happened in China 50 years ago.So people must labour and cannot
          loaf on the job.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The population must be controlled and communication with outside
          should be limited
        </p>
        <p>
          We must make the society as stable as possible,so common people
          should not communicate with outsider,except that all the nations on
          the earth have the same ideology.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          People can invovle themselves in politics and public affairs,but
          decisions are made by nation
        </p>
        <p>
          It's like the current policy in China,people can summit their
          suggestions - but whether it will be adopted or not depends.
        </p>

      What's the best and ultimate Utopia?
    </p><span style="margin-left: 1em"></span></h4>
    <p>
      Well,to summarize the whole article,I'll say there's no <em>best</em> or
      <em>ultimate</em> Utopia.Just like me ,anyone can have his/her ideal
      state.But the problem is,people nowdays don't want to,or refuse
      to,object to plant an ideal state in their mind. Is it because they
      think the current state is the best and <em>What is,is right</em>? The
      role of an ideal state is not for political reasons because not every
      one wants revolution.It is about guiding people's concept and wish
      towards the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>The ultimate Utopia is YOUtopia.</strong>
